# Machine Learning Coursera Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions to the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. The repository is organized by the course weeks, and each folder contains implementations of machine learning algorithms and techniques learned throughout the course.

## Folder Overview

### `Week 1 - Linear Regression`
- Implements **Linear Regression** using both univariate and multivariate data.
- Covers cost functions, gradient descent, and model evaluation techniques.

### `Week 2 - Logistic Regression`
- Implements **Logistic Regression** for binary classification problems.
- Includes regularization methods to avoid overfitting.

### `Week 3 - Neural Networks`
- Implements **Neural Networks** for complex classification tasks using forward and backpropagation.
- Covers the optimization of neural networks using gradient descent.

### `Week 4 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)`
- Implements **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for both linear and non-linear classification.
- Covers kernel tricks and maximizing margins for improved classification.

### `Week 5 - Clustering`
- Implements **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised learning algorithm for grouping data.
- Includes visualizations of clusters and clustering evaluations.

### `Week 6 - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems`
- Implements **Anomaly Detection** using Gaussian distributions.
- Covers **Collaborative Filtering** for building recommender systems using matrix factorization.
